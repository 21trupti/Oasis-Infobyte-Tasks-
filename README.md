# Oasis-Infobyte-Tasks-
Completed the tasks given by Oasis Infobyte.
fisrt task is to complete Flower Classification using iris dataset. We have used this dataset to recognise of flower. using Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
Here's a deep dive into the Iris Flower Classification project, covering everything from dataset details to advanced modeling techniques:

Iris Flower Classification â€“ In-Depth Description

1. Problem Statement

The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) using measurements of the flowers. This is a supervised classification problem.

2. Dataset Overview

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Number of Samples: 150

Number of Classes: 3 (Each class has 50 samples)

Features (all numeric):

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)


Target: Species (categorical: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)


Class Distribution:

Setosa: Easily separable from others

Versicolor & Virginica: Overlapping features, harder to distinguish



---

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for:

Pair plots: Visualizes feature relationships across species

Box plots: Shows distribution and outliers

Histograms: Understand frequency distribution

Correlation Matrix: Detects linear relationships


Insights:

Petal length and width are the most discriminative features.

Setosa is linearly separable from others.

4. Data Preprocessing

Steps include:

Checking for missing values (this dataset has none)

Encoding the categorical target using LabelEncoder

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (commonly 80/20 or 70/30)

Feature scaling (optional for some models like KNN, SVM)

5. Machine Learning Models

Common Classifiers:

Logistic Regression: Simple linear model

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Based on proximity

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective with small datasets

Decision Tree: Non-linear, interpretable

Random Forest: Ensemble of trees, more robust


Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Cross-validation for better generalization


Example code for model training (sklearn):

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


---

6. Model Comparison

You can compare multiple models using:

Accuracy scores

ROC curves

Confusion matrices


Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and improve performance.

7. Insights & Conclusion

Petal-based features are more important than sepal features

Simple models (like Logistic Regression) perform surprisingly well

Excellent dataset to demonstrate fundamental ML concepts

Can be used to teach EDA, preprocessing
